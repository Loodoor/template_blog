# A simple blog template
A blog template using PHP, JS, and possibly MySQL. CSS already included. Take care to change the .htpasswd and .htaccess

# How to

## Install

You just need to download the zip of the project and extract everything on your server.

If you want to change the header and the footer, just go in private/config.json and change the value of the json fields as you want :)

You don't need to setup any data base, we are using JSON files :)

We will as soon as possible add a test account (as an ADMIN), which you'll be able to modify ;)
